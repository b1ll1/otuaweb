# Welcome to Otua Web!

## Mission Statement
The aim of this project is to demonstrate to users how much they could be saving the environment by sharing car journeys with their friends and families (whilst saving plenty of money in the process!).

## Project Roadmap
1. MVP is to allow users to input their journey and whoever they are planning on picking up. The application will then calculate:
    1. Whether they could save money by sharing the journey.
    1. Who should pick who up to optimise the savings and how much the passenger should transfer to pay for their share of the fuel cost.
1. The next level up is to include a backend to store all of the wonderfully environmentally friendly journeys, as well as personal information such as car MPG, local fuel pricing etc.
1. Step 3 is to start thinking about how to incorporate a social network effect into the project. Of course the slicker we can get the user journey from going on the app to committing to a cleaner journey, the more likely they are to use the service.
1. Step 4 -> The fancy stuff, it would be cool to suggest shared journeys depending on useage patterns of friends and family. If we could prompt users to share, again they're more likely to be _nudged_ into action.
